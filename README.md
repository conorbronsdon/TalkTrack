# TalkTrack

Record, transcribe, and identify speakers from your calls — all locally on your machine. Free and open-source alternative to Evaer, Otter.ai, and Fireflies.

TalkTrack is a Windows desktop app for **recording and transcribing Microsoft Teams calls, Zoom meetings, Google Meet sessions**, and any other audio app. It uses [Faster Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) for local speech-to-text and [pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) for speaker identification. Everything runs offline — no cloud services, no subscriptions, no data leaves your PC.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or 11
- Python 3.10+
- A microphone

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ObscureAintSecure/TalkTrack.git
cd TalkTrack
```

Just double-click **`start.bat`**. On first launch it sets up an isolated environment and installs dependencies automatically — no manual steps needed.

> **Note:** dependencies are installed into a project-local virtual environment (`.venv`), **not** your global Python. This keeps heavy packages like PyTorch and pyannote.audio from polluting or upgrading packages in your system Python.

#### Recommended: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

If [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) is installed, `start.bat` uses it automatically. You can also drive it directly:

```bash
uv sync            # create .venv and install pinned dependencies from uv.lock
uv run python main.py
```

`uv sync` is reproducible (it installs the exact versions in `uv.lock`) and fast. By default it installs **CPU** PyTorch, which works on any machine.

#### GPU acceleration (NVIDIA, optional)

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, install the CUDA build of PyTorch for much faster transcription and diarization. CPU and GPU builds are mutually exclusive extras — pick one:

```bash
uv sync --extra cuda     # CUDA 12.6 build (NVIDIA GPU)
# CPU is the default; uv sync --extra cpu pins the CPU build explicitly
```

Without uv:

```bash
pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

Confirm it worked in **Help > System Status** (GPU Acceleration should read "detected with CUDA 12.6"), then set **Compute Device** to CUDA in Settings.

> Windows note: if `uv sync --extra cuda` fails with `failed to rename ... Access is denied (os error 5)`, antivirus is locking the large download in uv's cache. Retry, run `uv cache clean` first, or add `%LOCALAPPDATA%\uv\cache` to your antivirus exclusions. The plain-pip command above sidesteps it.

#### Without uv

If uv isn't installed, `start.bat` falls back to a local `.venv` created with Python's built-in `venv` + `pip`. To do it manually:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

> `requirements.txt` is kept in sync with `pyproject.toml` for users who prefer plain pip.

#### Custom taskbar icon

On first run TalkTrack offers to add a Start Menu shortcut (also available any time via **Help > Add to Start Menu**). The shortcut targets the project's `.venv` interpreter and carries the app icon, so Windows shows the correct taskbar icon. Launch from that shortcut, then right-click the running taskbar icon and choose **Pin to taskbar** if you want it pinned.

For troubleshooting, use **`start_debug.bat`** which shows a console window with log output.

### Speaker Diarization (Optional)

For multi-speaker identification (speaker 1, speaker 2, etc...), TalkTrack uses pyannote.audio which requires a free HuggingFace account. On first launch, a setup wizard walks you through the steps:

1. Create a free account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/join)
2. Accept the model license at [pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1)
3. Create an access token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
4. Paste the token into the wizard (or Settings > Transcription)

Without this setup, TalkTrack still works — it just labels speakers as "You" and "Remote" based on audio channels.

## Usage

1. Start your call in Teams, Zoom, or any app
2. In TalkTrack, select your microphone and the app to capture
3. Click **Record** (or enable auto-record in Settings > General to start automatically when your app joins a call)
4. When done, click **Stop** — transcription starts automatically
5. Review the transcript, assign speaker names, use **Play All** to follow along, then export

**Windows 11:** Select specific apps (Teams, Chrome, etc.) in the app picker to capture only their audio.

**Windows 10:** Captures all system audio via WASAPI loopback.

## How Transcription Works

TalkTrack uses [Faster Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper), a CTranslate2-optimized version of OpenAI's Whisper model. Everything runs locally — no audio is sent to any server.

### Pipeline

1. **Recording** — Audio is captured as dual tracks: your microphone and system/app audio. Both are saved as WAV files alongside a `combined_audio.wav` used for transcription.
2. **Transcription** — When recording stops, Faster Whisper processes `combined_audio.wav` and produces timestamped text segments. VAD (Voice Activity Detection) filtering skips silence automatically.
3. **Speaker Diarization** — Speakers are identified and labeled on each segment (see below).
4. **Review** — The interactive transcript viewer lets you play back individual segments, edit text inline, and assign friendly names to speakers. Changes are saved to `transcript.json` and `speaker_names.json` in the recording directory.

### Whisper Models

Choose a model in **Settings > Transcription** based on your speed/accuracy needs:

| Model | Size | Speed | Accuracy | VRAM (GPU) |
|-------|------|-------|----------|------------|
| `tiny` | ~75 MB | Fastest | Basic | ~1 GB |
| `base` | ~145 MB | Fast | Good | ~1 GB |
| `small` | ~480 MB | Moderate | Better | ~2 GB |
| `medium` | ~1.5 GB | Slow | Great | ~5 GB |
| `large-v3` | ~3 GB | Slowest | Best | ~10 GB |
| `large-v3-turbo` | ~1.6 GB | Fast | Near-best | ~6 GB |

Models are downloaded automatically on first use and cached locally. No internet is needed after the initial download.

### CPU vs GPU

- **CPU** (`int8` quantization) — works on any machine, no extra setup. Good enough for most use cases.
- **CUDA** (`float16`) — significantly faster if you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed. Select "CUDA (NVIDIA GPU)" in Settings > Transcription > Compute Device.

TalkTrack automatically detects your GPU and CUDA availability in the **System Status** panel (Help > System Status) and shows guidance if CUDA isn't properly configured.

### Language

By default, Whisper auto-detects the spoken language. You can set a specific language in Settings > Transcription > Language (e.g., `en`, `es`, `de`) to improve accuracy and speed if you know what language will be spoken.

## Speaker Diarization

Speaker diarization identifies *who* is speaking at each point in the transcript. TalkTrack offers two modes:

### Simple Mode (No Setup)

Works out of the box. Compares audio energy between your microphone track and the system/app audio track to label each segment as **"You"** or **"Remote"**. Best for 1-on-1 calls.

### Full Diarization (pyannote.audio)

Uses the [pyannote.audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) neural pipeline to identify individual speakers (SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc.). Works for any number of participants. Requires a free HuggingFace account — see [Speaker Diarization setup](#speaker-diarization-optional) above.

You can optionally set min/max speaker counts in Settings to help the model when you know how many people are on the call.

After diarization, use the **Speaker Name Panel** in the transcript viewer to map generic labels (SPEAKER_00) to real names. Names are saved per recording and included in exports.

## AI Assistant (Optional)

TalkTrack integrates with AI providers to generate meeting summaries, extract action items, and chat with your transcripts. AI features are entirely optional — the core recording and transcription works without them.
